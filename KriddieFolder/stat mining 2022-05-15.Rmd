## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
df <- read.csv(here::here("ProcessedData/SynopFlowAccu_20220419.csv"))
df <- df[,c("lon_fit","lat_fit","Flux_ave","adjusted_ppm","K600_effective","Wetland","dist","slope50m","RASTERVALU")]
colnames(df)<-c("x","y","Flux_ave","adjusted_ppm","K600_effective","Wetland","dist","slope50m","RASTERVALU")

GAVI <- df%>%filter(Wetland=="GAVI")
COLM <- df%>%filter(Wetland=="COLM")
ANTE <- df%>%filter(Wetland=="ANTE")
GAVItrib1 <- df%>%filter(Wetland=="GAVItrib1")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
TheData <- df
TheData$RASTERVALU_stats <- TheData$RASTERVALU / max(TheData$RASTERVALU)[1]
TheData$K600_effective_stats <- TheData$K600_effective / max(TheData$K600_effective, na.rm = TRUE)[1]
TheData$slope50m_stats <- -1*(TheData$slope50m / max(TheData$slope50m,na.rm = TRUE)[1])

plot(TheData$RASTERVALU,TheData$K600_effective) 
plot(TheData$slope50m,TheData$Flux_ave) 
plot(TheData$slope50m*-1,TheData$adjusted_ppm) 

a <- lm(TheData$K600_effective ~  TheData$RASTERVALU)
summary(a)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(TheData, aes(RASTERVALU, K600_effective, color=Wetland)) + geom_point()


```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
