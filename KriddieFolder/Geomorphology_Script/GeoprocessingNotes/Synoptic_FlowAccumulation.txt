
1.	Extract by mask to extract part of the dem that is
	> > Under environments change processing extent to “Union of Inputs” so that flow path
 is the same spatial extent is the same as DEM
2.	Rater calculator to convert flow path to value 1
			> Con("FlowPath_all" > 0,1,"FlowPath_all")
3.	Reclassify no data to 0
4.	Raster calculator
	a.	Use the raw DEM. DO NOT use the fill DEM rather than the raw DEM
	b.	Subtract reclass flow path from DEM
	c. it seems like the flow path*10 works well -- (kw note 2024-02)" I used 5m subtract
5. Use the resulting DEM to get to flow accumulation as usual
6. Raster to point
7. Snap: input feature is the xy synop point data
	feature: is the raster to point 
	type: vertex
	distance: 10 meters
8b.   Spatial Join 
	match option: intesect
8b. Instead of 9a, Extract Value to Point: extracts pixels from the raster 
	Input point features: xy synop data
	Input raster: flow accumulation

9. export attribute table, remeber to put it in a folder and add ".csv" for extension
